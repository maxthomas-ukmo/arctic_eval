## Overview
This repository contains ESMValTool recipes for evaluating climate models with an Arctic focus.

There are three evaulation tools for the Arctic:
- *sea ice*: with a focus on sea-ice data
- *transports*: which uses the StraitFlux package to calculate volume, heat, and salt fluxes through Arctic gateways
- *ocean*: which just updates an existing recipe to take HadGEM3 data
